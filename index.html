                         My name is Brian Alan Gibbons. I come from a family of 10 kids and I am the 6th child. I spent the majority of my childhood years growing up in Orem, UT. I grew up playing sports. I love basketball and football. I also loved playing legos, guns, swords, action figures and playstation with my 3 little brothers and neighborhood buddies. I'm currently in school striving to graduate with a bachelors degree in Web design and Developement with a concentration on UX design and I also work from home for a telecomunications company by the name of Cywest Communications. Below is a list of things I enjoy in life:

                        The reason I love design and more specifically UX design is because I really enjoy helping others. UX design, to me, is about creating an environment in which the user can not only succeed, but thrive. My goal in my design work is to design an experience for the user that is clear and simple to use. This means my job is to listen to my user's feedback and to be willing to adapt my project in any way that helps accomplish that task.
